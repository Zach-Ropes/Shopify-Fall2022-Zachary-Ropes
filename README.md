Shopify Digital Design Challenge - Fall 2022

## How To

This project was originally done before CORS policy interrupted a simple path search from the HTML file. To circumvent this issue, I started a python http server from the data folder and changed the path to localhost:8000. Lastly, all that needs to be done is open index.html in the project folder. The more info page also has more information on the page if wanted.

### The Problem

This project was to create a meaningful data visualization choosing a meaningful design strategy to best represent and get across a certain topic. For my project I chose to look at the inflation of salaries of NBA teams from 1991 to 2018 as well as player salaries and compared the performance of athletes to their overall salary to see whether athletes were underpaid, overpaid, or paid just right.

### The Process

My process in solving the process was a combination of using d3.js, HTML5 and CSS to make a data visualization that looked and gave insightful data on the subject. On top of this multiple csv data sets were used from data.world to come up with the graphs. This project was done mainly by myself despite having a partner due to my familiarity with coding compared to my partner at the time. Throughout the course of the project, multiple iterations were made slowly adding the original chart, then a comparison chart where individual players/teams could be compared, and finally adding css/color to the graphs to make the visualization pop. 

### The Solution

The solution is the effect the visualization has done to fully convey what we are trying to show. In a sense it's up to the opinion of the reader as most visualizations go. How well does the visualization convey information to someone who it is geared towards or even someone who has no idea what they are looking at. In the end it was up to the final viewer of the project to, or rather my professor in this case to which we received overall great marks.

### Reflection

This project wasn't necessarily hard but definitely a learning experience. As what comes with most new libraries that we work with as coders/data scientists, we must learn new ways to think and work with the data that is presented as well as how to utilize the new methods/functions. Looking back on this now there are definitely many things that I would add such as different graphical ways to visualize the data that may be more helpful to a viewer or even season by season comparison statistics that are better easy to read rather than just career averages.


### My Store

If I were to open a shopify store I would choose to sell products that would be able to make the most profit. These would most likely be cheap products that could easily be bought from aliexpress/amazon and marked up such as socks, shirts, and other gear. Also this clothing would have to have some kind of mainstream allure. In this case, I would lean towards something that is just becoming mainstream such as anime where the stigma behind anime is far in the past and just about everybody I know has begun watching some in one way or another.

### Final Thoughts

After 6 year of being a student athlete with many set backs (Covid, Surgery) and accomplishments (Bachelors, Masters), I am ready to begin my professional career and would love to join the Shopify team. I look forward to your response! Thanks for reading.

Sincerely,
